<h2 align="center">Text to Speech</h2>
<p>
    Once the user's input is translated they are giving the option to have the 
    translated text read to them. The user can choose between a male or female voice. Since a language can be spoken 
    in more than one region of the world, there is an option to select which region the voice is from.
